# Titanic_Dataset_Exploratory_Data_Analysis
## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python and a Kaggle Notebook. The analysis aims to understand the structure, quality, and patterns within the data, with a particular emphasis on factors influencing passenger survival.

The project was completed as part of a data analytics training assignment to strengthen practical skills in data exploration, visualization, and analytical reasoning using real-world data.

## Why I Did This Project
I undertook this project to:
1. Gain hands-on experience working with a real-world dataset.
2. Practice the full Exploratory Data Analysis workflow before modeling.
3. Improve my ability to identify data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
4. Develop data storytelling skills through visual and statistical analysis.
5. Build a strong portfolio project demonstrating core data analytics competencies.

## What I Did
The project followed a structured EDA approach:
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset to understand its structure, features, and data types.
- Profiled all features to identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques and justified decisions.
- Investigated outliers in numerical features and evaluated their impact.

## Performed:
1. Univariate analysis to study individual feature distributions.
2. Bivariate analysis to examine relationships between survival and key variables such as gender, age, class, and fare.
3. Multivariate analysis to uncover interaction effects between multiple features.
4. Conducted detailed target variable analysis on survival outcomes.
5. Created clear visualizations to support insights and interpretations.
6. Documented the entire process using clean, well-commented code and published the notebook.

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Kaggle Notebook

## Outcome
By completing this project:
1. I developed a strong understanding of the Titanic dataset and the factors influencing survival.
2. I gained practical experience in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis.
3. I improved my ability to justify analytical decisions based on data evidence.
4. I produced a fully documented and reproducible EDA notebook.

The project now serves as a portfolio artifact demonstrating my data analytics skills.
